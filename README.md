# Front-End-Developer-Project-3_Feed-Reader-Testing

# Project Overview

In this project, I'm gived a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, and I have performed unit testing by using Jasmine, which is a javaScript testing framework.


## Why this Project?

Jasmine is an open source testing framework for JavaScript. It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. It is heavily influenced by other unit testing frameworks, such as ScrewUnit, JSSpec, JSpec, and RSpec

## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

This project help me develop foundamental tests skills, which requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.

Effective tests give me the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within the codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.


# Development Strategy

- Download the repository as zip and extract it on local computer, or, type the clone command in the terminal.

- Open the index.html file in browser.

- The test will automatically run and give out the results.

All the test suite written in feedreader.js which can be found at /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js
